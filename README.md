# Machine-Learning
Based on Machine Learning created a model using Yolov5, Annotation Tools. This project offers a computerized approach to identifying motorbike riders who are not wearing helmets. This model will only take into account the bounding box territories of motorcycle riders that use a single structure. Algorithms used in our project are YOLOV5.
